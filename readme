This is the final project for CS 766: computer vision of Spring 21

This can be used to detect 1. Whether a person is wearing a mask. 2. Whether the mask is worn properly.


1. add new training pictures
- put in dataset/with_smask and dataset/without_mask

2. train the model to detect mask
- python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset

3. detect mask and whether worn properly with video stream
python3 detect_mask_video.py
